"TW // Suicide
Ooo here I have an idea because I'm sick of not knowing anything. 
So
I try this whole ""make things better"" thing ONE more time. One more.
And if it doesn't work..then I just..go.
Easy..simple
I can't keep doing this, and I'm sorry. I'll try again though..", ; ,2020-10-18 07:23:16, ; ,Forest_Fairy04, ; ,Twitter Web App, ; ,1317727936569434112, ; ,https://twitter.com/statuses/1317727936569434112
